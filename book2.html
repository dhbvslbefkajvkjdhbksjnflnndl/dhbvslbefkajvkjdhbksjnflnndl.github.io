          Today I saw <br>
          a man sleeping<br>
          on the pavement,<br>
          <br>
          “wot do u feel” <br>
          was written, in pen<br>
          across his arm.<br>
          <br>
          Sadness?<br>
          Or maybe relief.<br>
          <br>
          I don’t know.<br>
          <br>
          “I’m getting<br>
          some coffee. <br>
          Want some?”<br>
          <br>
          “Naaaaaaaaaaaah<br>
          I just had one.<br>
          Thanks anyway.”<br>
          <br>
          I watched him<br>
          fall back asleep<br>
          on the pavement,<br>
          <br>
          and felt tired.<br>

        <p>
          When walking, <br>
          sometimes I feel <br>
          groups approach <br>
          from behind.<br><br>

          I slow down. <br><br>

          I briefly imagine <br>
          I’m their friend. <br><br>

          I listen. <br>
          & nod along.<br>

        i asked for a matcha smoothie <br>
        made with soya, to go. <br>
        the lady behind me <br>
        told me that the packaging <br>
        was not recyclable. <br><br>

        I sat down and opened<br>
        my MacBook.<br><br>

        ?? Doesn’t she know about the soap?<br>

        Men who lift <br>
        their gut<br>
        up over <br>
        a belt strap<br>
        while looking <br>
        in your eyes<br><br>

        earnestly <br>
        telling you<br>
        their jeans size<br>
        hasn't changed <br>
        for 15 years.<br><br><br>


        I renewed my gym<br>

          A type of loneliness <br>

          Today I saw someone <br>
          ask for photos of dogs, <br>
          or kittens.<br><br>

          They were feeling <br>
          sad. They needed <br>
          help.<br><br>

          I started to type:<br>
          "have you tried Google?”,<br><br>

          but I realised<br><br>

          that they just wanted to know<br>
          that people out there cared<br><br>

          & I wasn't sure I did.<br>
